My simple philosophy is “Talk less, work more and Help other as you can!”
Throughout my career, I've noticed that I've always beed good with handling problems and leadership. To do something without having to be told to do it. when I work, I always take initiative. If I see something that needs doing, I don't wait for instruction, I do it. I believe that to be get anywhere in life, you need this quality.   
“Action is more important than an ordinary reaction”

               <p> Through summer internship program "Internsmela'20" I got my first internship in ZRAE Global, a robotics based company. I was assigned to a new wellness based project. The whole journey was a delightful experience. They had me comfortable in working and encouraged me at every point of my work. As a result of my dedicated input, I was offered to be the "Brand Ambassador of Zoelife". It is an organic wellness product with AI enabled health analysis. 
Everyone has a level of influence that can be harnessed for greater good. I get to preach what I practice.

Before getting placed, I was not familiar about artificial intelligence or corporate culture. Never hesitate to try out thing you are unaware of,Only then you will find out what your really capable of doing.</p>

From Biology to IT, coding made me feel both hate and love towards it at the same time.
Though the process of learning paired with coding made me explore from developing a mobile app to making machine learning models, most of these projects were built on the spot of coding events. Although the project works in the initial years were more intense, with more participation and learning, made me brag one or more prizes.
If I can do, You can too!. So don't sit in the class, just don't. You can always learn the academics, get your hands dirty by engaging into different competitions and keep on learning new things.

                <p>Hey, I'm Yazhini of Department of Information Technology, Sri Sairam Engineering College, Batch 2020. When I joined my UG here I was sure that I'm going to get a professional degree because that's what everyone will obviously expect from an educational institution. Never did I know that my college will expose me to the real world where only education is not enough to face it. I was given lot of opportunities to explore what  I am good at and support to exhibit what I have learnt along with standard education. From co-curricular activities like project expo, conferences to extra-curricular activities like extempore, dance, sports, my department encouraged me to participate and showcase my skills and talents. They always put our betterment above everything and provided various platforms to develop and enrich ourselves. It groomed me into a better human for the society and has given 3 wonderful career opportunities in companies like Accenture, TCS and Prodapt.</p>

                 Hi everyone, my four-year journey(2016-2020) in Sairam College was incredible. I have got wonderful staff members and many friends who have supported me in various situations.Our department was really good and encouraging where you can gain knowledge and achieve lot of success. HOD Mam is the strongest pillar of our department. In 2019, I have been elected as a Student Chairman of our department. It was a great experience for me as I am able to organize the grand event called Xtrofest'19, a mega technical fest conducted by our department. Overall 600 participants across the India were participated in this event. I am one of the top students in our college and I came from a rural tamil medium background. So don't underestimate your capabilities and identify your inborn talents from you which will elevate your future. -Senthilkumar J.

                 "Great things in life are never done by one person. They are done by a team of people. " This is something  IEEE taught me through shows they organize. Networking is not just collecting contacts but planting relations and sharing knowledge. From these people, I came across the highest award that an IEEE Computer Society Student Member can accomplish for his works. I was recognised for my commitment. I was awarded the Richard E. Merwin Scholarship with $1000 on January 4th, 2020. Then I became Brand Ambassador for IEEE, Section Ambassador for IEEE Programming League by IEEE CS SYP. Ultimately I am into IEEE India Council Student Coordination Team where I was selected among 34 from 700+ registrations nationwide".
